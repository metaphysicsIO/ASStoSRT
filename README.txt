# ASS2SRT

Advanced SubStation Alpha (ASS/SSA) doesn't work well on minidlna
and I need something to convert them to SRT files.

I only have a prototype made at the moment. It was made with mksh in mind. I
have also only tested it on one file, which it does work with.

It should be fairly easy to use a loop to make batch edits.

I plan to write this in C++ in the future. I will keep the prototype here
though. It might not even have a purpose to have in C++.

TODO: Create a batch option.

TODO: Remove the extra lines at the bottom of the SRT

TODO: Test against other files.
